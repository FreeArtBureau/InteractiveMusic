	VOICES

	If a Note is merely a mathematical model then Voices are where
	the rubber meets the road. Voices contain a Note and an oscillator
	so a Voice is a thing that can actually sing!
	
	If our Instruments were monophonic then we’d only need one voice
	that could be re-used to play any Note.
	But we’re polyphonic -- we can play multiple notes at once!

	Sending no arguments to a Voice will give you all default params
	and results in a playable Concert A:

	    var v = new Voice()
	    v.play()
	    v.stop()

	The intended use here is to create a Voice, optionally passing it
	a Note to begin with, and then alter its Note dynamically in a loop.
	Example: gliding from a Concert A to one octave lower could involve
	creating a Voice with no Note argument, calling its play() method, 
	then from within a loop assign the Voice a new progressively lower
	Note per loop until desired. 

	new Voice( 'eb3' )

//  We’re expecting up to two kinds of optional arguments: 
//  a note-like thing and an audio-connection-like thing.

//  There’s a hardware limitation of 6 Audio Contexts in total
//  so we’d like to connect this Voice to an existing one if 
//  possible. But if need be we can create a new one here.
