* Interactive Music Installations
* Gesture mapping
* Musical Installation Paper Prototyping

## Final Proposals - 1 minute each

PROMPT: A 9 minute performance / presentation of a piece of Interactive Music. It can take the form of an installation, game, instrument, interactive song, sonification, etc (if what you want to do is not on this list, just ask). 

CONSIDERATIONS: 
* What is the interplay/cohesion/tension between music, interaction and visuals? 
* How does interaction heighten the experience of the music?
* Who is your audience? How much are you asking of them?
* What is the setting/environment of your piece?

## Installations

### Spatialization

A simple way to create interesting and engaging interaction is simply using the physical properties of sound spatialized around a room. 

#### [Dream House - La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh6pAiAXqAo)

Dream House is simply a handful of specially-tuned sine wave generators. As you move around in the space, the waves collide with each other in different waves changing the spectral content of what you hear. It's extremely responsive, interactive and uses entirely analog and passive electronics. 

#### [Microtonal Wall - Tristan Perich, Sarah Rara](https://vimeo.com/45225412)

Similar to the Dream House, Microtonal Wall is an installation which the listener experiences by exploring a space.

#### [Forty Part Motet - Janet Cardiff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxIeulpigws)

Janet Cardiff's work often employs the technique of using speakers to embody people or characters. Her work is immersive and the interaction is simply moving around the space. 

#### [Zimoun](https://vimeo.com/7235817)

Zimoun uses materials and motors to create aleatoric musical installations. 

### Tracking

#### [Firewall - Aaron Sherwood, Mike Allison](https://vimeo.com/54882144)

Great example of mapping pressure and dynamics in an interesting way. 

#### [Trechery Of Sanctuary - Chris Milk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2kZdl8hs_s)

Chris Milk's piece effectively employs sound to heighten the experience of the piece. The forceful sound of the flapping wings slows the user down and makes them embody the bird.  

### Instrument

#### [Blow Up - Scott Snibbe](http://www.snibbe.com/index.php/projects/interactive/blowup/)

Augments the users breath using large fans.

#### [CrossFader - Luisa Periera](https://vimeo.com/41999322)

Super simple, no-tech, conceptual cross fader between two performers. 

#### [Reactable - Sergi Jordà, Marcos Alonso, Martin Kaltenbrunner and Günter Geiger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgy1S8qymx0)

A table with a camera underneath tracks fiducial markers on blocks. The placement and rotation of the blocks controls music music or sound effects.

### Environmental

#### [Subway Symphony - James Murphy](http://pitchfork.com/news/54088-james-murphy-previews-music-for-new-york-city-subway-stations/)

A proposed project which puts a lot of musical attention to the sound design of the New York Subway system. 

#### [Strings - Monica Bate, Johann Diedrick, Luisa Pereira Hors](https://vimeo.com/84474194)

Very architecturally striking design. Maps string plucks / stretches to samples and synthesis. 

#### [21 Balançoires (21 Swings) -  Daily tous les jours](https://vimeo.com/40980676)

Playful public installation where swinging on swings generates music. Clear mapping and lots of variation in rhythm and melody. 

#### [Playing the Building - David Byrne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gea9SYUdJeY)

Byrne connected a piano keyboard to trigger motors and actuators around the building. Great use of space and materials. 

#### [Piano Stairs - Remo Saraceni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOVHNGeDxKE)

Not great sound design / composition (IMO), but very clear mapping. 

#### [Voice Array - Rafael Lozano-Hemmer](http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/voice-array-by-rafael-lozanohemmer)

Responsive visuals

## Installation Prototyping

### MakeyMakey

Dead simple gesture controller. Uses any sensor to trigger keyboard and mouse events. Makes it very easy to use with a browser / jquery. 

### Synth - Stewart Smith

Very simple way to use key/mouse events to trigger notes. Quick way to make interactive melodies.

### Group work

Get into small groups. Make a "paper prototype" of an interactive musical installation. 

* What is the story? 
* What is the context? 
* How can you prototype the idea quickly?
