title : Midterm 1: Score
layout: default
---

Realize the score that you created last week. Your piece should be more than 1 minute, but less than 3. In your presentation, show your score and discuss your process of realizing your score.

You will present your pieces in front of the class next week. 

Where does the realization depart from your intention? Where is it cohesive?
