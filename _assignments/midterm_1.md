Realize your graphic scores. Your realization should be more than 1 minute, but less than 3. Your realization needs to be rendered (at least in part) using code. The code does not need to be complex; it can be as simple as playing a few mp3 files using p5.sound, or as advanced as synthesizing all sounds in real time. But use code as a tool to realize your piece.

You will present your pieces in front of the class next week. In your presentation, show your score and discuss your process of realizing your score.
