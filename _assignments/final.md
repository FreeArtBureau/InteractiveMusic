Create a piece of interactive music which will be presented for/with/to the class and guest critics. Your presentation should last about 7 minutes. 

**Bonus points**: If you include a performance as part of your presentation, your piece will ideally **not** be performed by you; instead try to coordinate with someone else (in the class or outside) before class so that they have enough time to learn and practice your piece. Please do not randomly call on a participant without first speaking with them. The goal of having someone else perform it is that it forces you to consider your listener/performer more than you might if it was just you performing your own piece. 

Feel free to expand on either of your midterms or start something new. You can use any language or software you want.
