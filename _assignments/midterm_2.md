title : Midterm 2: Gesture
layout: default
---

Compose a piece centered around a gesture. Like a violinist uses the gesture of bowing to realize a notated score, you will realize your composition through a gesture that you define, measure and use to create music.

Your piece should be more than 1 minute, but less than 3. 

The piece will be presented in front of the class.
