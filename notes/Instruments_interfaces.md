## Musical Interfaces

### Acoustic vs Electric

#### Acoustic Interfaces

* Sound source and interface are the same. 
* Fixed mapping. 
* Haptic Feedback. 

#### Electronic Instruments

* Sound and interface are separated by Mapping
* No built in feedback. 
* Indirect / Abstract mapping possible. 

### Purpose / Context

The purpose / context of the interface is extremely important. 

* Is the user an expert of amateur?
* What sort of music is created with the instrument?
* How might an interface for composition be different than an instrument for improvisation?
* Ergonomics?
* Relationship between performer and audience. 
	* Is it clear what the performer is doing? How she is manipulating sound?
	* How does this change in the context of interactive music which might not have the same notion of audience?


## Interaction Model

The interaction model is how people use the interface and how it responds to them (and importantly, how they respond back to it responding). Feedback!

### Basic Interaction Model

### Improvisatory Interaction Model

### Performative Interaction Model

The above models, but add in another feedback loop in which the audience listening affects the performer. 

### Feedback / Feedforward

Helps articulating control. 
Active Engagement. 
Clarity of intent.

## Mappings

### Complexity / Transparency

An entirely transparent 

* Feedback
* Complexity to stimulate creativity
* Transparency to keep link between input and resulting
sound (otherwise, danger of loosing the audience) 

#### One to One

Each gesture / input is mapped directly to one output. Clear and simple. Not terribly exciting. 

#### One to Many

One input controls multiple outputs. Higher level control but less control over details. Powerful. 

#### Many to One

Many inputs coupled to produce one musical parameter. Allows for greater expressive control and mastery. Finer degree of control. (e.g. Frequency and Detune knob). 

### Levels of indeterminacy

* Control vs. randomness (interactive improvisation)
* Total pre-determinacy: push play -> deterministic output. 
* Total indeterminacy: random machines. 

### Continuous vs. discrete control 

* Micro- to macro-level control: sound spectrum to details of
articulation to overall structure
