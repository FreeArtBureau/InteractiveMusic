## Dimensionality

The basic idea is to try to reduce the number of dimensions of interaction of your music to the fewest, but most powerful and expressive dimensions. 

### Conceptual Clarity

Back in the day of notated music, scores were another way a composer had to elucidate the underlying concepts of his/her piece. Ideas that may or may not have been obvious by just listening to the music.

Looking at a [Twelve Tone Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique) it's much easier to pick out the prime, retrograde, inversion, etc, than it is to hear those things in the music. [Schoenberg - Opus 23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A9HSlgDlQE)

The field of Musicology and Music Theory rely around this ability to identify, name, and reason about concepts and ideas that are preset in the score. 

But what about music which is composed/produced with a DAW or through software? How can we discover and reason about the composer's concept? Not having the ability to abstract musical concepts with something visual is like not having a word to describe an idea: we can circumlocute a concept, but we would get much further in our description and development of that idea if we had a word for it.
