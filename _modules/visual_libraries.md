### Three.js

WebGL and 3d graphics can be a powerful accompaniment to Web Audio enabling you to make rich audio/visual experiences. Three.js has already taken foot in the realm of interactive music videos. Here's a few example: 

[Arcade Fire - Just A Reflector](http://www.justareflektor.com/)
[Lights - Ellie Goulding](http://lights.helloenjoy.com/)
[Three Dreams of Black - Danger Mouse & Daniele Luppi](http://www.ro.me/)

### [Two.js](https://jonobr1.github.io/two.js/#introduction)

Two.js' API is inspired by Three.js. It uses SVG instead of WebGL for rending. This makes it more widely supported than Three.js (though that's becoming less and less true). 

It excels at making blobs and smooth lines and is also easy to animate existing SVG graphics.
