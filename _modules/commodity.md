Many musicians obviously benefit from the commodification of music so they can make a living. 

> "_The commodity character of music tends radically to alter it._" Music, [Adorno] thought, "has ceased to be a human force and is consumed like other consumer goods," which "produces 'commodity listening,' a listening whose ideal is to dispense as far as possible without any effort on the part of the recipient--even if such an effort on the part of the recipient is the necessary condition of grasping the sense of the music. (Adorno 2009b, 137)"

## Inventing the Phonograph

> That Edison didn't conceive of his device as one that could play professionally recorded music wasn't surprising, for he lived in an era when music was still something one made for oneself or heard live. The idea that one would pay for previously recorded music was foreign to most people, and indeed Edison resisted entering the business of selling prerecorded music, though he ultimately acquiesced, as he and others slowly became accustomed to the idea that musical sound was something that could be purchased.

> Persuading the public, long accustomed to making their own music and hearing music live, to purchase a player piano or a phonograph (or, later, a radio) took several decades of promotion by the recording and broadcasting industries. Consumers at first had to be assured that they weren't surrendering agency, that they were bringing their interpretive powers to the "performance" of player piano rolls.
