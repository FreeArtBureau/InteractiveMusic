When we talk about scores, we are talking about creating representations and abstractions of music. They are not sound, but instructions for creating it. They are interpreted by someone or something. 

**Audio files are not sound itself, but abstract representations of it. Is an mp3 a score?**


Scores were another way a composer had to elucidate the underlying concepts of his/her piece. Ideas that may or may not have been obvious by just listening to the music.

Looking at a composition done in the [Twelve Tone Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique), it's easier to pick out and verify the prime, retrograde, inversion, etc, than it is to hear those things in the music.

The fields of Musicology and Music Theory rely on this ability to identify, name, and reason about concepts and ideas that are preset in the music.

But what about music which is composed/produced with a DAW or through software? How can we discover and reason about the composer's concept? Not having the ability to abstract musical concepts with something visual is like not having a word to describe an idea: we can describe a concept, but we would get much further in our description and development of that idea if we had a word for it.

**If we can somehow manipulate sound itself, is there a reason for a score?**

## Code as score

In the first Computer Music language, [MUSIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSIC-N#Design), Max Matthews made a distinction between the sound generators and the sound organizers. These are often referred to as the "Orchestra" and the "Score". 

The "Orchestra" is the part of your code where you create all your instruments, effects, etc, and the "Score" is the part of your code where you sequence events or set values and dial in and control all the values in the Orchestra.
