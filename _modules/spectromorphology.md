> Spectromorphology is the perceived sonic footprint of a sound spectrum as it manifests in time.

[Spectromorphology](https://github.com/igoumeninja/ofSpectrograph/blob/master/bibliography/Spectromorphology%20Explaining%20Sound%20Shapes_%20D.%20Smalley.pdf) is also the name of a very famous paper published in 1986 by Denis Smally. 

Addresses the inadequacy of traditional notation in capturing the endless sound-generating possibilities of computers. It grapples with similar topics as we covered in the graphic notation module, if we can't abstract sounds into instruments/notes/rhythms, how can we compose and reason about them?

> Until the electroacoustic medium arrived, all music was created either through forms of vocal utterance or through instrumental gesture. A human agent produces spectromorphologies via the motion of gesture, using the sense of touch or an implement to apply energy to a sounding body. A gesture is therefore an energyâ€“motion trajectory which excites the sounding body, creating spectromorphological life.

### Source Bonding

Associating sounds sources with what is perceived to have created that sound.

### Gesture and Its Surrogates

Before electroacoustic music, all sound was produced through sound-making gestures. From the perspective of the sound-creator and listener, the musical gesture process is tactile, visual and aural. 


### Onset, Continuant and Termination

* attack-impulse. Modeled on the single detached note: a sudden onset which is immediately terminated.
* attack-decay (closed and open) - modeled on sounds in which the attack-onset is extended by a resonance that quickly or gradually decays towards termination. The closed form represents a quick decay which is strongly attack-determined. 
* graduated continuant - Modeled on sustained sounds. The onset is graduated, settling into a continuant phase which eventually closes in a graduated termination.
