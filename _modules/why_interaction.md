title : Why interaction?
layout: default

If we use the definition "[music is organized listening]({{site.baseurl}}/module/what_is_music)", then the imperative if we want to create music is to create _listening_, without it, we are not making music. 

Interaction is one way to compel listening and engagement with music. The music becomes a live experience. Different every time. Personal. The listener is an integral part of the experience. Listening is not optional.

**Is the use of technology imperative in creating _Interactive Music_?**

Why make something interactive?

Why make interactive music?

Why NOT make interactive music?

## Why programming?

> I automate whatever can be automated to be freer to focus on those aspects of music that can't be automated. The challenge is to figure out which is which.
