# Cohesion with Visual Music

How do sounds interact with visuals? 

How do you create cohesion between color/sound/form/movement/concept?

What is an intuitive mapping between sound and visuals? 

Music exists in time, so perhaps clear mappings have to do more with movement and gesture (Spectromorphology) than with shape and color.

## [Photoplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplay_music)

The metaphor here is that the music follows and enhances something else which is going on. The "composed" system is about mirroring interaction which is intended for something else.
