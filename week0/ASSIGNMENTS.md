## ASSIGNMENT - Parameters

Pick a musical constraint/parameter, make a piece of music which explores that dimension. 1-2 minutes. Email me an audio recording and a brief description including what parameter you composed with. Could be low-tech/no-tech. Please encode it as an mp3. I like [this](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xld/) mp3 encoder if you don't already have one.
