## ASSIGNMENT

Continue working on your sound making objects with the goal of the midterm and library in mind. Think about what you want to do for your midterm and figure out a useful piece of that application. Keep it simple! See how expressive and musical you can be with as little as possible. 

Think about the Beethoven example of a ["cell"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_%28music%29) or motif which you can apply in a number of ways and let a user interact with.

Make music!
