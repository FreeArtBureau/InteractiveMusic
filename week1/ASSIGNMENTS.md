# WEEK 1

## ASSIGNMENT - Exploring implementation

Try to implement the same sound/gesture in two (or more) ways. Write briefly about how the implementations affected the results. A trivial example would be implementing a sine wave with two different kinds of synths. But if the oscillators sounded very similar, you wouldn't have a lot to talk about. A similar, but more developed example might be implementing the same melody with two different instruments and discussing how the mood and conception of the melody were completely changed by this implementation choice. The assignment is about highlighting how implementation choices affect the musical result. 

Sounds should be less than 30 seconds.
