# SYLLABUS

## OVERVIEW

The first part of the course will cover the tools and techniques of interactive music. We will focus mostly on JavaScript and the browser as the platform for interactive engagement with listeners/players. The second part of the course will focus on the aesthetic and artistic considerations of interaction: mappings, interfaces, and interactions.

	* `new`
* Encapsulation
	* members
	* methods
	* `this`
* Interfaces

### [WEEK 6: Mid Terms](week6/).

* In class presentation/performance of an interactive instrument/composition using the sonic objects that you've been developing for yourself to use as well as each other. 
* Data Sonification
* Refactoring
* Documentation
* Extensibility

Assignment: package up some class/feature from your midterm with documentation and at least one example of how to use it. We are creating a library of sonic objects from people's assignments which can be used, combined and remixed for the final assignment.

### WEEK 11: Final Presentation

PROMPT: A 9 minute performance / presentation of a piece of Interactive Music. It can take the form of an installation, game, instrument, interactive song, sonification, etc (if what you want to do is not on this list, just ask). 

CONSIDERATIONS: 
* What is the interplay/cohesion/tension between music, interaction and visuals? 
* How does interaction heighten the experience of the music?
* Who is your audience? How much are you asking of them?
* What is the setting/environment of your piece?
