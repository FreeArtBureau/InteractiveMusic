# SYLLABUS

## CLASS ETIQUETTE

* Come to class on time (or early! especially if you need to set something up).
* Let me know in advance if you need to be excused for an absence (emergencies only!).
* If you don't understand something, please ask. If you think it's a complex and specific question, come to office hours or email me.
* **Lids down** while your classmates are presenting/talking. You can use your computers the rest of the time to supplement/research/dive deeper into what we're discussing in class. Please don't mindlessly flip through your feed or email. 
* Most importantly, be an engaged student. Listen to your classmates, create for them and with them, give compliments, give feedback, share references and knowledge.
