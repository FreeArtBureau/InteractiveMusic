# SYLLABUS

## OVERVIEW

The first part of the course will cover the tools and techniques of interactive music. We will focus mostly on JavaScript and the browser as the platform for interactive engagement with listeners/players. The second part of the course will focus on the aesthetic and artistic considerations of interaction: mappings, interfaces, and interactions.
